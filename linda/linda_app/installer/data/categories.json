An example would be assigning a given email into \"spam\" or \"non-spam\" classes or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn the terminology of machine learning, classification is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e. learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available. The corresponding unsupervised procedure is known as clustering, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity or distance.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOften, the individual observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known variously explanatory variables, features, etc. These properties may variously be categorical (e.g. \"A\", \"B\", \"AB\" or \"O\", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. \"large\", \"medium\" or \"small\"), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a part word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure). Other classifiers work by comparing observations to previous observations by means of a similarity or distance function.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAn algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete implementation, is known as a classifier. The term \"classifier\" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.\r\n</br><br/>\r\nFor More Info: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification</a>\r\n</div>"

It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using different measures of interestingness. Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal et al.[2] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.\r\n\r\n</br><br/>\r\nFor example, the rule {onions, potatoes} -> {burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, Continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\r\n\r\n</br><br/>\r\nFor More Info: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables \u2013 that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, the estimation target is a function of the independent variables called the regression function. In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the variation of the dependent variable around the regression function which can be described by a probability distribution.\r\n</br><br/>\r\nRegression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. Regression analysis is also used to understand which among the independent variables are related to the dependent variable, and to explore the forms of these relationships. In restricted circumstances, regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. However this can lead to illusions or false relationships, so caution is advisable;[1] for example, correlation does not imply causation.\r\n</br><br/>\r\nMany techniques for carrying out regression analysis have been developed. Familiar methods such as linear regression and ordinary least squares regression are parametric, in that the regression function is defined in terms of a finite number of unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. Nonparametric regression refers to techniques that allow the regression function to lie in a specified set of functions, which may be infinite-dimensional.\r\n</br><br/>\r\nThe performance of regression analysis methods in practice depends on the form of the data generating process, and how it relates to the regression approach being used. Since the true form of the data-generating process is generally not known, regression analysis often depends to some extent on making assumptions about this process. These assumptions are sometimes testable if a sufficient quantity of data is available. Regression models for prediction are often useful even when the assumptions are moderately violated, although they may not perform optimally. However, in many applications, especially with small effects or questions of causality based on observational data, regression methods can give misleading results.\r\n</br><br/>\r\nFor More Info: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A commonplace example might be estimation of some variable of interest at some specified future date. Prediction is a similar, but more general term. Both might refer to formal statistical methods employing time series, cross-sectional or longitudinal data, or alternatively to less formal judgmental methods. Usage can differ between areas of application: for example, in hydrology, the terms \"forecast\" and \"forecasting\" are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times, while the term \"prediction\" is used for more general estimates, such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period.\r\n</br><br/>\r\nRisk and uncertainty are central to forecasting and prediction; it is generally considered good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attaching to forecasts. In any case, the data must be up to date in order for the forecast to be as accurate as possible.\r\n</br><br/>\r\nFor More Info: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting</a>\r\n</div>"
