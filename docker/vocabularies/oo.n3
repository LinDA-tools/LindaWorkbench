We've created the twitterHashtag in the open org namespace. A hashtag can be related to a concept, location, event, or anything. A combination of hashtags may be used in one literal to indicate that it is that combination of hashtags which is associated with that resource.

Having two oo:twitterHashtag properties, however, would indicate that either is used to refer to the same thing (not recommended).

<oo:twitterHashtag>#myconf2010<oo:twitterHashtag>

or, to indicate a combo hashtag:

<oo:twitterHashtag>#myconf2010 #track2<oo:twitterHashtag>

    a bar or other entertainment venue with the fire limit for the venue
