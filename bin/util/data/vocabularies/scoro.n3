	dc:description """Since roles have contexts and times that are important to take into account (for example, a person can be author of one paper and reviewer of another, while another person will be editor of a journal only for a defined period, not for ever), the SCORO ontology permit these contexts to be specified, using an ontological design pattern called the time-indexed value in context (TVC) (http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc/) which is part of the PRO ontology (http://purl.org/spar/pro/) imported by SCORO. 
 
This ontology design pattern permits one to construct the following RDF statements:
       foaf:Agent pro:holdsRoleInTime [ a pro:RoleInTime pro:withRole pro:editor ] .

Thus the domain of pro:withRole is not foaf:Agent, but rather an anonymous member of the class pro:RoleInTime, which itself is the range of the property pro:holdsRoleInTime, for which the domain is foaf:Agent. 

The range of pro:withRole is the class pro:Role, and its sub-classes pro:PublishingRole, scoro:InvestigationalRole, scoro:OrganizationalRole, etc., whose members permit specific roles to be specified.  
   
This single step of indirection permits other contextual and temporal attributes (not shown here) to be specified for this member of the class pro:RoleInTime, putting that role into context.

Exemplar usage: 

fabio:Dataset  dcterms:contributor  [ rdf:type foaf:Organization ; 
   foaf:name \"Met Office\" ;  
   foaf:homepage <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/>  ; 
   pro:holdsRoleInTime [ a pro:RoleInTime 
      pro:withRole  scoro:data-creator ]  ] .

Exactly the same use of TVC and of individuals within the class scoro:Contribution and its sub-classes is used for scoro:withContribution, enabling contributions to be time-limited and given contexts."""^^xsd:dateTime ;
