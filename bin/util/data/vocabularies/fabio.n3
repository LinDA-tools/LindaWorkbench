Additional properties have been added to directly and reciprocally link frbr:Work to frbr:Manifestation and frbr:Item, and frbr:Expression to frbr:Item."@en ;
	rdfs:comment """FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, was created by splitting the bibliographic classes out of the Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO v1.6, into this separate ontology, to permit its use for describing bibliographic entities using FRBR, independent of citations.  FaBiO was then extended.

Separately, the new version of the CiTO Ontology was created by splitting out the object properties cito:cites and its sub-properties, and cito:isCitedBy, from CiTO v1.6 into this new ontology, to permit them to be used free of the domain and range constraints imposed by cito:cites and cito:isCitedBy."""@en ;
