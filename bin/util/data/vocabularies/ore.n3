ore:AggregatedResource a rdfs:Class ;

ore:Proxy a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Proxy" ;
	rdfs:comment "A Proxy represents an Aggregated Resource as it exists in a specific Aggregation. All assertions made about an entity are globally true, not only within the context of the Aggregation. As such, in order to make assertions which are only true of a resource as it exists in an Aggregation, a Proxy object is required. For example, one might want to cite an article as it appears in a specific journal, or assign aggregation-specific metadata to a Resource." ;

The ore:aggregates relationship expresses that the object resource is a member of the set of Aggregated Resources of the subject (the Aggregation).

	rdfs:comment "ore:lineage is a relationship between two Proxy objects, both of which MUST have the same Resource for which they are proxies.

The ore:proxyFor relationship is used to link the proxy to the Aggregated Resource it is a proxy for.

ore:similarTo a rdf:Property ;
	rdfs:label "Similar To" ;
	rdfs:comment "The subject of this relationship MUST be an Aggregation.  This Aggregation should be considered an expression within the ORE context of the object of the relationship, as it is broadly equivalent to the resource. For example, the Aggregation may consist of the resources which, together, make up a journal article which has a DOI assigned to it. The Aggregation is not the article to which the DOI was assigned, but is a representation of it in some manner." ;
