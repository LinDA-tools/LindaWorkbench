	dc:description """FRAPO is an ontology for use to describe research project administrative information and to work with CRIS (Current Research Information Systems). It can be used for the characterization of grant applications, funding bodies, projects, project partners, etc.  It can also be used to describe other types of projects, for example building projects and educational projects.  

FRAPO imports FOAF and is designed to work with SCoRO, the Scholarly Contributions and Roles Ontology (http://purl.org/spar/scoro/), which is used to characterize the contributions and time-limited roles that may exist between agents such as people and organizations and entities such as projects, research investigations or research outputs.  

FaBiO, the FRBR-alightned bibliographic ontology (http://purl.org/spar/fabio/), provides terms for documents of relevance, such as grant applications, project plans, project reports, datasets and journal articles, which are therefore not included within FRAPO.

FRAPO is not intended to describe the details of research investigations enabled by funded research projects, nor their component studies and assays, which are the domain of a complementary ontology, ISA-RDF (under development - add URL)."""@en ;
